# ATAF
Get and speak Florence's bus system timetables.



## Arduino
To make a bus stop that shows timetables and speaks them use an Arduino YÃ¹n.

I've used an Uno so the ethernet part of the sketch is missing from the ino.

Build the circuit on a breadboard then load the sketch on the Arduino board.


## Install
To install this software run the following command in ZSH:

`curl -L raw.githubusercontent.com/dardo82/ATAF/master/bin/install.sh | zsh`


## Shell (ZSH)
The script needs a bus stop code as argument:``ataf FM0571 &``.

Refer to http://www.temporealeataf.it/ to get them.
